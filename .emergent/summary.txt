The AI engineer successfully initiated the ALORIA AGENCY project, transitioning from a detailed product vision to a functional MVP. After clarifying key requirements with the user—confirming full JWT authentication, polling-based messaging, and a focus on Canada/France immigration data with a document *checklist* instead of uploads—the AI proceeded with development. The initial phase established a FastAPI backend and a React frontend utilizing Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS. A significant portion of the work involved researching immigration procedures for Canada and France, then rapidly prototyping the core application structure and multi-role dashboards. Following user feedback, the AI executed a comprehensive UI/UX redesign, adopting a dark bleu nuit theme with orange accents and translating all interface elements to French, ensuring text visibility across all updated dashboards and pages.

*   **Manager (Administrateur):** Create/modify users, view consolidated dossiers with KPIs, reassign cases, update statuses, access all messages, generate reports, manage visitor registry, configure country-specific workflows.
*   **Employee (Conseiller Immigration):** Create clients, manage client portfolio, update assigned case steps, view/manage document checklists, message clients, view calendar for appointments and deadlines, receive notifications.
*   **Client:** Access personal dossier, visualize step-by-step progression, view required document checklists, message assigned advisor, receive automatic notifications, download official documents, view advisor's profile.

**Core Functionalities Built So Far:**
*   **Authentication & Onboarding:** Full email and password-based authentication, initial public landing page with a contact form.
*   **Multi-Rôle Dashboards:** Fully designed and translated (French) dashboards for Manager, Employee, and Client roles, displaying placeholder data for KPIs, lists, and progression.
*   **Design & Language:** A dark theme dominated by Bleu Nuit (#1A2238) with Orange (#FF6B35) accents, and all UI text translated to French.

**Specific Implementation Notes:**
*   Document upload was explicitly replaced by a checklist of required documents updated by the manager.
*   Messaging is planned to be polling-based.
*   Research on official immigration sites for Canada and France was conducted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on a major UI/UX overhaul and language translation for the ALORIA AGENCY application. The user explicitly requested a darker aesthetic, reducing the prevalence of white space and emphasizing the bleu nuit theme with orange accents, along with a full translation of all UI texts into French.

The work involved:
1.  **Tailwind Configuration Update:** Modifying  to define a custom color palette that prioritizes  (dark blue) and , which was then applied globally.
2.  **Global CSS Redesign:** The  was rewritten to establish the new dark background and ensure proper application of the chosen color scheme across the entire frontend.
3.  **Page-level Redesign and Translation:**
    *   The  was completely rewritten to reflect the dark theme and translate all content into French, including the initial inquiry form.
    *   The  was also fully redesigned with the dark theme and localized into French.
    *   The dashboards for , , and  underwent extensive modifications using  to update their color schemes, translate all dynamic and static texts to French, and enhance readability against the darker backgrounds.
The current state of the product features a cohesive, elegant dark UI with all user-facing content presented in French. The core routing and authentication mechanisms are in place, and the dashboards are visually complete, awaiting the integration of their full functional logic.
